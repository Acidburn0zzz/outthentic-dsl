# Playing games with outthentic dsl

[Outthentic](https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic-dsl) - is language to parse unstructured text. 
It was grown as supporter for web application test tool named [swat](https://github.com/melezhik/swat).
Web application is where text often comes in unstructured and unordered way, even though there is json and
xml, there are a lot of applications when it is not the case.


Then I branched a generic test tool called analogously - [outthentic](https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic),
this is already tool for any kind of testing tasks and it's based on outthentic dsl as well.

Creation a new consumers of outthentic language is way too easy, with [API](https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic-dsl#parser-api) exposed and explained at
outthentic documentation.

What I try to do in this short post is to highlight some randomly picked features to let reads to have a sense what is
outthentic way to analyze and verify text output, which of course could be used wide in daily testing tasks.

If when read this post you feel like to know more - an official outthentic documentaion is [here](https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic-dsl)
and ( less formal ) - [here](https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic-dsl/blob/master/intro.md)


# Parsing text blocks 

Sometimes you are given with output of text blocks. A classic thing are html tables.

Imagine a table with two columns of ABC letters and a position numbers:

    Letter  Number
    A       1
    B       2
    C       3
    ...
    Z       26


    <table border=1>

        <tr>
            <td>
                Letter
            </td>
            <td>
                Number
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                A
            </td>
            <td>
                1
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                B
            </td>
            <td>
                2
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                C
            </td>
            <td>
                3
            </td>
        </tr>

    <!-- and so on till Z --> 

    </table>


Let's write up a dsl code to verify that:

* we have table 26 rows with 2 cell in each one
* a first cell of every row is ABS letter and second one is a number



between: <table.*> </table>
    <tr>
end:
